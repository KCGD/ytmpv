Welcome to my YTMPV (v1.0.0)!

This is the YTMPV backend, responsible for communicating with the ytmpv browser extension and playing youtube videos in mpv.

Usage: ytmpv <args>
    -h  --help                      Prints documentation (what you're seeing now)
    -P  --port  <port>              Specify port for ytmpv to listen on (default is 7999)
